# Digital Clock
This project is a simple digital clock implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time and updates dynamically every second.

# How It Works
The digital clock retrieves the current time using JavaScript's Date object. It then formats the time into hours, minutes, and seconds, accounting for the 12-hour format and the AM/PM time indicator.

The HTML structure consists of a heading, a clock container, and two elements: one to display the time and another to indicate the time format (AM/PM). The CSS file styles the clock and provides a background image. The Orbitron font from Google Fonts is used to enhance the futuristic appearance.

# Usage
To use the digital clock:

Download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Place them in the same directory.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
The clock will automatically start displaying the current time and update every second.

# Customization
You can customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the CSS in the style.css file. For example, you can adjust the font size, colors, or background image to suit your preferences.

# Dependencies
This project uses the Orbitron font from Google Fonts. The necessary CSS link is included in the HTML file to ensure proper font rendering.

# Compatibility
The digital clock should work in modern web browsers that support JavaScript and CSS3 features.

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the creators and contributors of the Orbitron font and Google Fonts for providing free and open-source fonts.

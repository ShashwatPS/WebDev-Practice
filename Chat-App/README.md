# Socket.io Chat App

This repository contains a simple chat application built using the popular Node.js library, Socket.io. It enables real-time communication between clients using websockets.

## Features

- Real-time chat: Users can connect to the server and exchange messages in real-time.
- User connections: The server logs when a user connects to the chat application.
- Minimalistic UI: The frontend interface provides an intuitive chat experience.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/socketio-chat-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd socketio-chat-app
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the chat application.

## How It Works
The application is built using Node.js and Express for serving the HTML page and static assets. The core functionality of real-time communication is implemented using Socket.io. Socket.io allows seamless communication between the server and clients using WebSockets.

When a user connects to the chat application by accessing the root URL, they are presented with a basic chat interface. As users send messages, Socket.io enables instant delivery of messages to all connected clients.
